If songs.db were to contain the top 100 songs from Spotify Wrapped in 2018, the person seems like an all around style
person. This means they have a lot of different genres, however a lot of them are rap and hip hop. This may not be very
representative of the person however since the way I calculated this was by seeing the songs they listened to in 2018 alone.
Additionally, it is not known how long they listened to each song for and how many times which would be key factors in this
evaluation. To fix this, maybe we can find out the aura by knowing the persons overall songs listened to in order of most
to least played as well as know who their favourite artist is.
