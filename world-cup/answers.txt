Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

As the number of simulations grew, many of the predictions proved incorrect such as Belgium likely because
after running more and more trials, the accuracy of the test was enhanced.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would say after 10000 simulations, the predictions could be considered "good enough". This is because in terms of time,
this number still makes the simulations run fast while conducting a large number of tests. After 10000, the time begins to slow
considerably.
